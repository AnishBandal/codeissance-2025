# üîê LeadVault ‚Äì Secure Lead Management System

---

## **Project Overview**

**LeadVault** is a secure, role-based lead management system designed to streamline lead creation, assignment, and prioritization.  
It supports **offline-first functionality** for field staff, leverages **AI-powered scoring**, and enforces strict **access control**.

- **AI Scoring:** Returns **Lead Conversion Probability (0‚Äì100%)** and Loan Payment Reliability (0‚Äì100%)  
- **RBAC:** Role-Based Access Control ensures only authorized users perform specific actions.

---

## **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend:** React PWA (Progressive Web App)  
  - Offline support using **Service Workers** and **IndexedDB**
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + MongoDB
- **AI Scoring:** FastAPI microservice
- **Authentication & Security:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

---

## **User Roles (RBAC)**

| Role                  | Description                                           |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Higher Authority**   | Can create Nodal Officers, view all leads            |
| **Nodal Officer**      | Assigned to a zone, can create Processing Staff      |
| **Processing Staff**   | Tied to a Nodal Officer, can create leads (offline enabled) |

---

## **Core Features**

### **Authentication**
- JWT-based secure login and registration
- Password hashing with **bcrypt**

### **Role-Based Access Control**
- **Higher Authority:** create Nodal Officers, access all zones
- **Nodal Officers:** create Processing Staff for their zone
- **Processing Staff:** create leads, manage assigned leads

### **Lead Management**
- Full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints
- **Audit logs** for every action
- **Zone-based filtering** of leads
- Offline lead creation in PWA (syncs when online)

### **Smart Assignment**
- Nodal Officers assign leads using **AI recommendations**
  - Based on **staff workload**
  - **Proximity** to leads

### **AI Scoring**
- Backend sends lead data to **FastAPI ML service**
- Returns **Lead Conversion Probability (0‚Äì100%)**
- Used to **prioritize leads** and display urgency

## **AI Models**

### **1. Lead Conversion Prediction**
- Type: Binary Classification (Convert / Not Convert)
- Input Features:
  - Age, Experience, Income, Family, CC Spending, Education, Mortgage
- Output: Lead Conversion Probability ‚Üí used for prioritization
- Threshold Mapping for Demo Visibility:
  - Probability ‚â• 0.5 ‚Üí Lead Score 50‚Äì100% ‚Üí **Likely**
  - Probability < 0.5 ‚Üí Lead Score 0‚Äì40% ‚Üí **Unlikely**

### **2. Loan Payment Reliability**
- Type: Binary Classification (Pay / Default)
- Input Features:
  - Income, Education, Existing Loans, Lead Score
- Output: Probability of repayment (0‚Äì100%)
- Threshold Mapping:
  - ‚â• 0.5 ‚Üí High reliability
  - < 0.5 ‚Üí Low reliability
